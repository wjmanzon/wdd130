                <p>Think about the last time you had a job interview. How did it go? Did you feel confident? Did you feel well prepared during the interview? <br>
                    <br>
                    If you got hired, good for you, If not, it’s okay. I’m here to help you. I’ve been there. I’ve applied for A LOT of jobs and got rejected A LOT of times. Do you know what made the difference? My confidence. <br>
                    <br>
                    Did you know that 39% of job applicants get rejected due to a lack of confidence? Your confidence during the interview is influenced by the quality of your preparation before the interview.
