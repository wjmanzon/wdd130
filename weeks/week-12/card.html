    <p>@wjmanzon</p> 
    <p>Hi, I'm Wilson. You can call me Wil. I'm from the Philippines, studying AAS Business Management online.
        Next year, I'll be transferring to campus to pursue a BS degree in Business Analytics. </p>

    <p>I currently work full-time as a Virtual Assistant at <a href="https://www.Soar.com">Soar.com.</a>
        One of my tasks is to create WordPress websites.
        I don't code, so taking this course will hopefully improve my web design knowledge and skills.</p>

    <p>I'm excited to learn with you all.
        If you want to connect with me outside the class,
        here's my <a href="https://linkedin.com/in/wjmanzon">
