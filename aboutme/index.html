    <p>Hi, I'm Wilson. I'm from the Philippines, studying AAS Business Management online.
        I hope to transfer on campus next year and take BS Automotive Management.
        Do you or someone you know take the same major? I'd love to connect! </p>

    <p>I've been married for about four years now. My wife and I were blessed with a son
        who just turned three this month.</p>

    <p>I currently work full-time as a Virtual Assistant at <a href="https://www.Soar.com">Soar.com.</a>
        One of my tasks is to create WordPress websites.
        I don't code, so taking this course will hopefully improve my knowledge and skills.</p>

    <p>I'm excited to learn with you all!
        If you want to connect with me outside the class,
        here's my <a href="https://linkedin.com/in/wjmanzon">
            linkedin account</a></p>
